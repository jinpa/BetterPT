# Project context for AI

**Cursor** loads **`.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc`** automatically (concise: goal, stack, conventions, scripts, constraints, quick run).

**Export strategy and full PRD:** [playwright-prd.md](playwright-prd.md). **Auth/API details and script notes:** [docs/PROJECT_NOTES.md](docs/PROJECT_NOTES.md) — read when needed. Legacy context (requests-based): `.cursor/rules/deprecated-v1-project-context.mdc`.
