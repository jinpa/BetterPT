# Project context for AI

**Cursor** automatically loads project context from **`.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc`** (with `alwaysApply: true`). That file contains the full summary: goal, tech stack, conventions, key scripts, constraints, and quick run.

If you're not in Cursor, read `.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc` for the same content. Full product plan: [prd.md](prd.md).
