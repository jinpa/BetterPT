# Project context for AI

**Cursor** loads **`.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc`** automatically (concise: goal, stack, conventions, scripts, constraints, quick run).

**Auth/API details and script notes** are in **`docs/PROJECT_NOTES.md`** — read when you need them, not every time. Full plan: [prd.md](prd.md).
